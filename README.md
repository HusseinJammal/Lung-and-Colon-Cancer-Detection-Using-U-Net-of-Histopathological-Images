# Lung-and-Colon-Cancer-Detection-Using-U-Net-of-Histopathological-Images
## Description
This project aims to detect lung and colon cancer from histopathological images using a U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The model processes a dataset of 25,000 images, categorized into five different classes, to identify patterns indicative of cancerous tissues. This approach showcases the potential of deep learning in medical image analysis and contributes to early and accurate cancer detection.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
